        <p>
            I’m a fifteen-year-old attending high school in New Jersey.
            I grew up in both India and the United States (8 and 7 years respectively).
            In my family, I have my parents, my brother, and a dog.
            I also have my friends who I talk and play video games with continually.
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m interested in a variety of things but they all generally fall within the broad scope of STEM:
            sciences like microbiology and chemistry and technology like basic programming, web development,
            and other general computer things.
            <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, I love to listen to music; I’m almost never seen without headphones on.
            Here’s what I’ve been listening to so far:
