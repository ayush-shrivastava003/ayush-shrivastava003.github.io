        <p>
            I’m a fifteen-year-old attending high school in New Jersey.
            I grew up in both India and the United States (8 and 7 years respectively).
            In my family, I have my parents, my brother, and my dog.
            I also have my friends who I talk and play video games with all the time.
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m interested in a variety of things but they all generally fall within the broad scope of STEM:
            sciences like microbiology and chemistry and technology like basic programming, web development,
            and other general computer things.
            <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, I love to listen to music; I’m almost never seen without headphones on.
            Here’s what I’ve been listening to recently:

                            The site you're looking at now took a lot to build and a good amount of previous experience with web design.
                            By far the most difficult part of this project was adapting it for mobile users.
                            I hope it looks great on all screen sizes.

                            This was my first attempt at making a website. 
                            I built it with a good friend of mine and we had a lot of fun.
                            While we've stopped working on the project now, it would be cool to see it published and used regularly.

                            I worked as an organizer on the tech team for HackPHS 2022, a local hackathon.
                            I helped with building the website and creating the DevPost, and ran an introduction to Python workshop.
                            Additionally, I helped to manage the event by serving food, ensuring judging went smoothly, etc.
